New York Times Slidescreen Plugin
=============

Since I wanted to get a little experience doing something real in Android and I am a user of Slidescreen AND a developer at the [New York Times](http://developer.nytimes.com/), I created this plugin that puts [nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com) homepage articles into Slidescreen.

This is still a strictly beta version of a plugin for a beta product. Thus, no guarantees for everything. Also, although I am a developer at the New York Times, this is in no way an official product of the New York Times. Use at your own risk.

### Caveats

* Currently it just fetches the main feed. Future versions might allow you to pick a different feed or multiple feeds.
* This does not support breaking news alerts. If you want those, get the official New York Times application.
* If you have the NYTimes Android application, that will be launched if you long or short press the T icon.
* I couldn't really get a hollow version of the T icon to look good, so it's filled solid for now. If you can do better, let me know.
* I still have yet to create a detail view page for an individual story. Currently, clicking them goes right to the mobile website.
* Better integration with the official NY Times Android application might be possible, I should probably go ask them.
